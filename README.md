Overview
This repository contains Python-based examples of integrating AI with social media platforms to create advanced chatbots. The project demonstrates how to use APIs from OpenAI and various social media platforms to build, customize, and deploy chatbots that enhance user engagement and automate communication.

Features
OpenAI API Integration: Leverage OpenAI's powerful language models to generate responses and handle user queries.
Social Media APIs: Integrate with Telegram and Discord to create interactive and responsive chatbots.
Custom Bots: Create and deploy custom bots with tailored functionalities for different use cases.
How It Works
API Integration: This project utilizes the OpenAI API to generate intelligent responses based on user input. You'll need an API key from OpenAI to use this functionality. For social media platforms, you'll use their respective APIs to manage interactions and messages.

Setup and Configuration:

OpenAI API: Obtain your API key from OpenAI and add it to your configuration file. This key is used to authenticate requests and interact with the language model.
Social Media APIs: Register your bot with Telegram or Discord to get API tokens. These tokens are required to connect your bot with the respective platforms.
Bot Development:

Telegram Bot: Use the Telegram Bot API to create a bot, handle updates, and respond to user messages.
Discord Bot: Utilize the Discord API to set up a bot, manage events, and interact with users in Discord servers.
Customization: Modify the provided templates and scripts to tailor the bot's behavior and responses according to your needs. Add custom commands, handle different types of messages, and enhance the bot's functionality.

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Python-based-AI-and-Social-Media-chatbot-Integration.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure API keys and tokens:

Create a .env file in the root directory and add your API keys and tokens:
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
TELEGRAM_API_TOKEN=your_telegram_api_token
DISCORD_API_TOKEN=your_discord_api_token

python bot.py
